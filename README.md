## My Work
Here's a glimpse of the projects I've been working on:

- **PostmartketOS-Installer**:
- PostmarketOS, also known as pmOS, is an open-source operating system primarily for smartphones, based on the Alpine Linux distribution.
- It was launched on May 26, 2017, and the source code was initially available on GitHub before migrating to GitLab in 2018.
- The development of postmarketOS is a collaborative effort by the postmarketOS open-source community.
- The project aims to provide a ten-year lifecycle for smartphones and is designed to run different X and Wayland based user interfaces.
- But to install this OS to your supported device you need to flash through fastboot! It's good for the developers thought but bad for general users to install it on their devices.
- So i thought why not make a GUI (Graphical User Interface) Which will help users to flash the image file to their devices and also both the developers and users able to flash the Beta & Stable images.
